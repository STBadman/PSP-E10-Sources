# Python repository to reproduce figures in  Badman+ "Prediction and Verification of Parker Solar Probe Solar Wind Sources at 13.3 $𝑅_\odot$" - submitted to JGR Space Physics 2023/1/31

This repository contains :

* `CSV/` - a directory containing archived CSV files from the PSP footpoint prediction campaigns which are the subject of this work
* submodules 
    * `kent_distribution` - forked from https://github.com/edfraenkel/kent_distribution and updated to work in python 3.0. This module can fit a Kent distribution (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kent_distribution) to an input set of points on the unit sphere.
    * `solarsynoptic` - cloned from https://github.com/dstansby/solarsynoptic. This module downloads EUV full disk images of the Sun, reprojects them into the Carrington frame (longitude vs latitude bins) and can combine multiple days of images into a full-sun map.
    * IMPORTANT : In order to correctly pull these submodules into your local cloned copy, please navigate to this directory in your terminal and run: `$> git submodule update --init`
* `.gitignore` - this stops git tracking ancillary data and output plots generated by running the main notebook
* `.gitmodules` - metadata which allows the submodules to be properly tracked
* `README.md` - this readme
* `SourcesPaperFigures.ipynb` - a jupyter notebook which runs through each figure, downloading the data it needs along the way. "Fig#.png" files will appear in the directory.
* `helpers.py` - useful python utility functions used in the main notebook
* `requirements.txt` - a listing of the packages and versions for which this repository has been tested. You can install them all at once with `pip install -r requirements.txt`. __Windows Users__ : You may need to install the v2.0.0 pre-release of streamtracer : `pip install streamtracer --pre` (See https://github.com/dstansby/streamtracer/issues/61)
